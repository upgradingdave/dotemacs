These are my customizations to the Emacs Starter Kit. 

* Install

  First, setup elpa by adding this to `emacs.d/init.el`

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
  (package-initialize)
  
  (when (not package-archive-contents)
    (package-refresh-contents))
  #+END_SRC 

  Next, clone this repo. Then rename the directory to your username.
  Move the directory into the `.emacs.d`. 

  Run my-init.el manually once to install the emacs-starter-kit (and
  other favorite packages). After that, the el files inside this
  project should automatically get picked up every time emacs starts.
